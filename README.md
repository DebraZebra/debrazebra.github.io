## Dissertations & Dragons 
### *A board game about graduate school.* 
Working on your thesis is tough. Between classes, 
office hours, and homework, there is not much time left to work on this massive project. 
You originally thought Dr. Dragon would be a great advisor, but the midnight phone calls
and brutal thesis revisions are not all you dreamed they would be; still you persevere. 
Some days it is tempting to play video games, cook a feast or take a trip to Iceland- 
anything but work on your thesis. Your cohort understands your plight. Do your work, 
write your dissertation, slay the dragon and graduate on time.
